# Game_UIU

I made this game when I used to study in United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.
It's a simple puzzle type game. I made it with the iGraphics library from www.selfloop.com.
Download all the files in the same folder. In order for iGraphics to work, look at installation instructions from the website.
Enjoy!
